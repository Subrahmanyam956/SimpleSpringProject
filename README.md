# SimpleSpringProject
This is a Simple Spring project to show us the basics of how spring works 
In this project, we define a class whose bean needs to be created.
Then we make all the required operations in this class.

Then in this project, I have a congiguration xml file.
Here we take beans from the xml file. 

We then use the conigured bean using ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and get the created bean and use that bean.
